# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to  determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Results
1. Firstly, a new table was created to segregate and show the employees as per their titles. As per the table below, it can be seen that employees have held multiple titles during their tenure.

2. Next, the selected data was filtered to show all the unique titles for employees.

As per these tables and analyses, it can be seen that the Senior ENgineers and Senior Staff are among the top 2 categories that  staff, especially the Senoir Engineers are in the retierment age. Also, it can be established that 1549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program. 

## Summary
Additionally, we could look into breraking down the retirees as per department as it will give us details of which department needs should be addressed first. With the silver tsuanami, it can be established that an expected 90398 employees are about to retire. So that many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact.

Also, there seems to be no dearth to the number of reitrement ready employees considering that there are 29414 Senior Engineers and 28254 Senior Staff. However, considering an imminent silver tsunami expected, the company may consider a rather phased roll out of the mentorship programs concentrating on the departmants with the highest expected retirees. 
A sample table which can be further looked into could give more insights as to which deprtament would make it to the priority list to engage in mentorship program.
